A copy of our Right Dialer app, which has a number of differences:<br>
 - a wide selection of background colors instead of preset colors<br>
 - the dial pad is now part of the recent calls list instead of a separate screen<br>
 - different dial pad buttons<br>
 - changed behavior of the call answer slider; the slider only appears when the screen is locked or turned off; in other cases, there will be answer buttons or a notification. <br><br>
